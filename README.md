Use Reddit and all of it's hidden gems to begin understanding some context around the test administered and how to invest your time correctly and wisely. The NCP-MCI is new ish and very hard to find any exam dumps worth the $50 - $100. At the time of this writing I did test and check to see the validity of two exam dumps; both provided roughly 150-218 questions and each had less than 4/5 that showed up on the actual exam. 

Here at Nutanix we do have blueprints available for certification tracks. In theory - anyone technical with access to a cluster should be able to validate each question and answer from repition of the blueprint. 

I personally do not like the tests administered from Nutanix. They are boring and remind me of VMware certifications. Currently, they are centered around precise and exact steps for tuning knobs on a certain code version. It's arbitrary and you learn in my opinion very little. 

Nutanix FRAME, Calm, Karbon, KPS, Clusters, Leap, and Era will drive a replatform of the Nutanix certification experience. My guess is a facelift in 2022.
